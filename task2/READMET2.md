# Task 2 - **Design and implement an Authoritative DNS server using a Client-Server system that uses UDP socket.**

## Introduction

Within the zip file attached we have both 'Task 1' and 'Task 2' codes available in separate folders. Likewise, we have a separate 'Makefile' and 'README.md' file for each task.

For Task 2, there are only two files you need to focus one, the '**client.py**' and '**server.py**'.

## Usage

Before running 'Task 2' appropriately, make sure to...
 - Have two terminals open, side-by-side
 - Be cd'd within the 'task2' folder

To run the client, paste in the below...

    make run arg=client.py

To run the server, paste in the below...

    make run arg=server.py
